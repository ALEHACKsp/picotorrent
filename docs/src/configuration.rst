Configuration
=============

PicoTorrent uses a SQLite database to store everything from configuration to
session and torrent states. It can be queried with any SQLite tool.

* If installed, the database file can be found at
  :file:`%APPDATA%/PicoTorrent/PicoTorrent.sqlite`.
* If not installed, the file will be placed next to :file:`PicoTorrent.exe`.
